# 100 Days of SwiftUI Challenge

Welcome to my repository documenting my journey through the [100 Days of SwiftUI Challenge](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui). I chose this course as my starting point for my iOS development journey because it offers a rich collection of sample apps that progressively build your skills. Throughout this challenge, I built a series of SwiftUI projects that helped me explore animations, state management, and more, all of which have been instrumental in laying a strong foundation for my future endeavors in iOS development.

## Projects Overview

Below is an overview of each project including its title, purpose, and key features.
