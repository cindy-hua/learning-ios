# 📱 learning-ios

A personal repository documenting my journey learning **iOS development** at the beginning of 2025. This repository brings together both **theoretical foundations** and **hands-on projects**, all rooted in official Apple documentation and high-quality learning resources.

## 📚 Learning Path

Between **January and February 2025**, I followed a structured curriculum combining theory and practice:

- **Official Apple Resources**
  - [Swift Language Guide](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/)
  - [Apple's Swift API Design Guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/)
  - [SwiftUI Tutorials](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/)

- **100 Days of SwiftUI** by [Paul Hudson](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui)
  - This intensive program allowed me to build real apps while solidifying my understanding of Swift and SwiftUI.

## 🔍 What You'll Find in This Repo

- 📘 Notes and summaries of concepts covered from:
  - Swift book chapters
  - Swift API Design Guidelines
  - SwiftUI architecture and design patterns

- 🛠 Projects built during the **100 Days of SwiftUI**, with additional explanations in each project's README.
  > Go to the [`100-days-of-swiftui`](./100DaysOfSwiftUI) folder for more details on each project.

## 🧑‍💻 Sample Screens of My Projects

Here’s a quick glimpse at some of the apps I’ve built so far:

## 🚀 What's Next?

This foundational phase helped me develop both:
- A **solid understanding of Swift and SwiftUI**
- A **portfolio of mini-projects** that show my progress over time

Now, I'm looking forward to building more complex, original applications and exploring areas like:
- Animations and gestures
- Networking and data persistence
- Dependency Injection and clean architecture
- Publishing to the App Store
